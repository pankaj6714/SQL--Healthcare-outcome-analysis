Project: Healthcare outcome Analysis and Risk Stratification
Department: Medical Healthcare Department
  Trying to creating a "Risk Stratification" tool using SQL, MS Excel and Python for:
  - Complex care management
  - High Risk care management
  - Disease management
  - Preventive Health

EXCEL  - Excel will be used for all the trends, Correlations and KPIs.
PYTHON - * Python will be used to build and validate machine learning models.
         * Deploy an interactive web application using streamlit.
         * Handle scalability and real world data.
SQL    - Retrieveing patient data and appling Aggrigating opperations like: Average result, Counting specific results, total and Highest cost, distribution etc.

Risk Stratification Process: It is in 4 steps
1) Gathering Patient Data - I have shared 4 CSV files [Patients, Labs, Diagnoses, Outcomes] for refrence
2) Scoring and Risk stratification - Analyse, how much risk the specific patient is going through. ex: Deagnosis, treatment, level of risk
3) Coordinating care & intervention - After analysing we have the data and on basis to it we can create plane according to it and coordinate with other departments.
4) Monitoring progress & Adjust care plane
